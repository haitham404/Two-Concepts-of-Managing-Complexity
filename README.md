TWO CONCEPTS OF MANAGING COMPLEXITY
=================================================

introduction
------------
In programming, managing complexity is one of the most important skills you’ll develop. Modern systems are built from millions of components, and understanding every detail is impossible. Instead, we use techniques like *abstraction* and *encapsulation* to simplify and organize code effectively.

what is  abstraction?
-------------------
Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary details and focusing on what’s important. Think of it like driving a car:
- You don’t need to know how the engine works to drive the car.
- You only need to know how to use the steering wheel, pedals, and gears.

In programming, abstraction allows us to work with high-level concepts (like arrays) without worrying about low-level details (like memory management).

levels of abstraction in programming
------------------------------------
The image below shows the levels of abstraction in an electronic computing system and how it maps to programming:

Level                Example in Programming
-------------------------------------------------
Application Level    Your program (e.g., a Java application).
Software Level       The Java programming language and its libraries.
Operating Systems    The OS that manages memory and resources.
Architecture Level   The Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Logic Level          The logic gates and circuits in hardware.

When you use an array in Java, you’re working at the application level. You don’t need to worry about how the JVM or OS manages memory—this is abstraction in action.

what is encapsulation?
----------------------
Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a *class*. It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is achieved using *access modifiers* like `private`, `public`, and `protected`.

In simpler terms:
- Encapsulation *groups related data and methods together*.
- It *controls access* to the data, often hiding it from outside interference.

key idea of encapsulation
-------------------------
Encapsulation is like a *capsule* that wraps data and methods together, exposing only what is necessary and protecting the rest.

example of encapsulation in java
--------------------------------
Here’s a practical example of encapsulation in Java:

why is this encapsulation?
--------------------------
1. *Data is Private*: The `balance` attribute is marked as `private`, so it cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the `BankAccount` class.
2. *Methods are Public*: The methods `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `getBalance` are `public`, providing controlled access to the data.
3. *Bundling*: The data (`balance`) and methods (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `getBalance`) are bundled together in the `BankAccount` class.

key benefits of encapsulation
-----------------------------
1. *Data Protection*: Prevents unauthorized access or modification of data.
2. *Controlled Access*: Provides controlled access to data through methods.
3. *Code Maintainability*: Groups related data and methods, making the code easier to maintain and extend.
4. *Flexibility*: Allows you to change the internal implementation without affecting the external interface.

abstraction vs. encapsulation
-----------------------------
- *Abstraction*: Hides *implementation details* (e.g., how a method works internally).
- *Encapsulation*: Bundles *data and methods* together and controls access to them.

final definition of encapsulation
---------------------------------
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (like a class) and controlling access to the data, often by making it private and exposing only necessary methods to interact with it.
